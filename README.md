🛟 ResqDisAI — AI-Powered Disaster Response Platform
ResqDisAI is an intelligent crisis management platform that accelerates rescue and relief operations in disaster-affected areas. It combines real-time data gathering, AI-driven urgency triage, geolocation mapping, and automated dispatching — all in one place.

🚨 Problem Statement
In disaster or crisis events, victims face:

❌ Difficulty accessing emergency channels

❌ Scattered and uncoordinated rescue information

❌ Delays caused by manual triage and logistics

✅ Our Solution
ResqDisAI delivers a centralized, AI-powered rescue platform designed for rescue agencies, NGOs, and volunteers:

📡 Multi-source ingestion: Accepts SOS via SMS, Twitter, and Manual Entry

🧠 AI classification: Evaluates urgency, type of need, and sentiment from messages

📍 Location detection: Auto-tags geolocation (with offline fallback)

🚨 Automated dispatch: Sends requests to nearby responders

📊 Live dashboard: Tracks criticality, dispatch status, and request density on maps

⚠️ Due to hackathon time constraints, and issues faced with our original code(crisis-backend, web-app) base we had to pivot to Replit a the last minute for development and testing to ship things and finish in time, what you see above are both code bases-original code(crisis-backend, web-app), and Replit-All other files, please reachout to us for any clarification, thanks!
